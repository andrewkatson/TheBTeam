This document is placed in every shareware evaluation package from Match
Software, Inc. It outlines the few requirements needed to distribute such
material. Match Software shareware evaluation packages are intellectual
property of Match Software, Inc. Although these files are proposed for
free evaluation purposes to the public, Match Software reserves all
copyrights.  Derogation to these rules are only possible with prior
permission of Match Software, Inc. Any infringement on Match Software
copyright will be subject to the strongest legal action.

Match Software is a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals 
(ASP). All good standing ASP distributor members are welcome to 
immediately start distributing Match Software shareware evaluation 
packages, as long as they respect points 1 & 2. Non ASP distributors must 
make sure they comply with the other points outlined in the following 
text.

1 - Archives as prepared by Match Software must not be modified in any
way prior to distribution. Their content must not be modified in any way,
would it be by suppression or addition of information.

2 - Under no circumstance any part of Match Software shareware evaluation
packages should be used as component of any other software product
without prior consent of Match Software, Inc.

3 - Good standing ASP approved vendors, and distributor members, can
immediately proceed to publish this package on CD, as well as diskettes.
Any CD publishing from non-ASP vendors must be approved by Match Software
prior to publishing.  Authorization can be obtained easily by e-mail or
letter. Match Software reserves the right to refuse authorization if the
publisher or it's representative does not provide adequate information
about the publishing project. Publishers must also provide Match Software
with a sample of the published CD package, as soon as it is available.

4 - On-line services, BBS, Internet sites and other electronic networks
are free to distribute on-line Match Software evaluation packages, as
long as they respect points 1 and 2.

5 - Magazines who decide to distribute Match Software shareware
evaluation packages as part of a promotional disk enclosed with their
current copy benefit from our intellectual property. They must get prior
approval by Match Software before publishing. We request the elementary
corporate courtesy of them sending us a free copy, as soon as published,
for our record, as they would normally request if any or part of their
articles was republished by one of their peers.

6 - Always use the latest version of the shareware packages, which you
can download from our web site : http://members.aol.com/MatchSoft If you
cannot find a specific package, please ask for it by eMail. We will send
it to you electronically as return message.

These requirements as simple and resort to elementary good sense. Match 
Software prepares these shareware evaluation packages with great care, 
and updates them regularly, in order for the public to receive the best
service as possible. The latest version of our archives are currently
available on our Web site : http://members.aol.com/MatchSoft/

Shareware is meant for Match Software as a meaningful and sensible way of 
marketing it's products. In doing so, many benefit from the generous 
efforts of the company : distributors, some of whom without shareware 
would probably loose a good part of their business, as well as users, who 
enjoy the privilege to use and test at will quality software before
buying it. Nevertheless, we welcome any offer of new ways of
distribution, publication or otherwise profitable ventures. The main
ingredient of most software products being not plastic or paper, but
creativity, we are quite sure some of our new ideas may find in
industrious hands a fortunate destiny. Please contact us, if you think
Match Software creations can profit your business !
