This font is a shareware evaluation package, distributed as an evaluation
sample of the large Match Software Font Library. It is functional, but may 
lack some features of the registered version. Most often, punctuations, 
and upper-ascii charcaters (accented) have been removed. You have as much 
time as you wish to evaluate it any way you see fit. When you have decided 
it is actually fine enough for you to use it regularly, we ask that you
contribute the modest amount of $9.95. This will enable us to cover some of
the cost of development, and you will be entitled to legally use this
font, for yourself or the business your represent. You will also receive 
the registered version of the font, which will be more complete.

Better yet, order the sampler on which this font is featured, for $19.95 only.
This is a great deal : a whole disk of legitimate, registered fonts, for
a very low price.

If you want to distribute this font as part of a shareware collection or
package, please contact us first, or read the guidelines included into
this archive (VENDOR.DOC, or "Distributors Welcome").

- Mister Potato : this font is one of the most original treasures of the
chest. You first enter the face you want on the screen, Mr. Cauliflower,
Mr. Potato, Mr. Pumpkin, etc., and then add his eyes, arms, legs, hat,
etc. A ton of fun for one or several children, who will have hours of fun
creating new characters, and play with the printouts to create cardboard
figures, mobiles, or masks.

drawings. Really attractive, and original text books can be generated
with this amazing novelty, a grand classic revisited. Great too for
letterheads, postcards, fairy books and lots of other marvelous projects
- Norman Prince : although there is a wealth of "script" fonts around,
none of them take into account the needs of young children, which is to
have an accurate representation of each character, as well as a style
closer to their calligraphic abilities. Here is a very nice script font,
resembling very well an excellent pupil's work. You may love it for
creating children's books, as well.

fascinating for any age. One the most ancient civilizations has brought
to us one of the most interesting ways of writing, through figurative

it in. Tell stories as the ancient scribes did, during the Pharaoh's era.
