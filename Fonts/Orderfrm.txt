Important message to our Overseas foreign customers
---------------------------------------------------
Remember: Credit cards are probably the safest, and most convenient
way to pay from abroad.

E.E.C (European Economic Community) customers may pay with checks in
their own currency, for the counter value of the dollar amount. Please
make checks payable to Michel Bujardet.

You may send us at your convenience cash, traveler checks (easily
available at your current bank), postal or international money orders.
For cash, make sure to conceal the notes to avoid any trouble during
postal transportation. For electronic money transfers, please contact us
by fax or email to obtain our current bank number.

We are sorry not to be able to take checks payable on European banks 
(even Eurochecks in $). Bank collection fees close to $20 make it 
impossible.

If you are currently a Compuserve customer, you may want to register
on-line, (GO SWREG) which is far easier, and will be charged directly 
through your regular Compuserve bill.
